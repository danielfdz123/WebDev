            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p> 
                Hi, my name is Daniel and I am currently a 21 year old CUNY Hunter College student who is pursuing a bachelor degree in Computer Science!
                As of now I have learned a lot in C++ and Python, but I am eager to learn different languages like html, java, css, and others to further expand my knowledge in the world of computer science.
                When it comes to hobbies and things outside of school, I really like to hang out with my friends. Whether  it's us hanging out in person, or playing videogames at home, it is always a blast!
                <br>
